<h3>From the Customers</h3>
<blockquote>Knight Irrigation came by my house and discussed my system needs and wants with me and gave me an estimate that night!  Kynn and his team showed up on time and did a 7 zone install in less than 6 hours for the price he quoted. They also took the time to follow up with me with regards to any issues or problems; my experience with Knight Irrigation could not have gone better!</blockquote>
