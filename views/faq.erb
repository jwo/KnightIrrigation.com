      <dt>If I am having an Irrigation System installed, what can I expect my yard to look like afterwards?              
      </dt>
      <dd>Most Irrigation Systems are installed with hand-dug trenches. Your grass is carefully removed               and then replaced after the installation is complete. In most cases, you can’t even tell you had a               sprinkler system installed!
